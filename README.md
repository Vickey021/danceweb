# Dance Website
This project is a modern, responsive website for a dance studio.
It allows users to book tickets for events, enroll in courses, and inquire about services.
The website uses a PostgreSQL Neon database to handle contact form submissions, and it's fully hosted on Vercel for easy access.

## Key Features
Event Booking System: Users can purchase tickets for events and download them directly from the website.
Workshop Section: Provides information about upcoming workshops and allows users to explore them.
Course Enrollment: Users can view available dance courses and inquire about them via the contact form.
Contact Form: Integrated with PostgreSQL Neon to store user inquiries and feedback.

## Technologies Used
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Backend: PostgreSQL Neon (for contact form integration)
Deployment: Vercel (for hosting the website)
